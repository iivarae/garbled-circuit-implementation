# Garbled Circuit Implementation - CSE410 Final Project

### How To Use:
1. Run the garbler.py file
2. When prompted, enter a valid input
3. While the garbler.py file is still running, run the evaluator.py file too
4. When prompted, enter a valid input
5. Should output the evaluated response

### How To Change Circuits for Evaluation:
1. Enter the garbler.py file and scroll all the way down to the main function
2. Main() has a single parameter that's set to "Millionaire.json" by default. Change this parameter to any valid json file to compute on a different circuit
